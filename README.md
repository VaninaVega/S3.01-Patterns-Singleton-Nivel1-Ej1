# S3.01-Patterns-Singleton-Nivel1-Ej1

## Summary: exercise description

In all exercises, create a project with a Main class that demonstrates the use of the pattern (with the necessary invocations).

Singleton
Create a class that replicates the operation of the 'Undo' command. This class will be used by the Main class, which will allow you to enter options via console.

The 'Undo' class must save the last commands entered. It must allow you to add or delete commands, as well as list the last commands entered (similar to the 'history' command in Linux).
The 'Undo' class must implement a Singleton pattern.
